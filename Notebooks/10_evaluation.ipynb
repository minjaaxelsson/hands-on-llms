It introduces the concepts of time dilation and length contraction, which describe how time and space are perceived differently depending on the relative velocity of observers. Special relativity also leads to the famous equation E=mc², establishing the equivalence of mass and energy.\n",

They have been reported to achieve scores in the 80-99th percentile on graduate admissions tests like the GRE and LSAT, and their programming abilities are said to compare favorably to those of average software engineers. Additionally, LLMs can solve complex mathematical problems and generate creative outputs, such as poetry, showcasing their versatility and advanced capabilities.\n"
